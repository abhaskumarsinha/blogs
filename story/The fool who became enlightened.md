# The Wisdom of Silence

In a realm where kings ruled over vast lands, there lived a proud monarch named Raghavendra. He was known for his wisdom, yet one day, in a moment of heated argument with a revered rishi, his temper flared, and he uttered words that brought upon his unborn son a curse of foolishness.

Remorseful and seeking redemption, Raghavendra pleaded for mercy. The compassionate rishi, unable to revoke the curse, bestowed a boon upon the unborn prince – that in time, he would find true wisdom.

Years passed, and the prince was born with a simple mind, mocked by the court for his foolishness. Yet, bound by an oath to always speak the truth, he wandered the kingdom, an honest soul in a world of deception.

One day, the prince ventured into the forest, where he encountered an injured wild boar. With a kind heart, he tended to the creature's wounds, sheltering it in his humble hut. As the boar rested, its pained cries echoed through the trees – "Ain, ain" – a sacred bija mantra invoking the Devi's enlightening grace.

Soon after, a hunter approached, desperate to feed his starving family. "Have you seen a wild boar?" he asked the prince. Caught between truth and compassion, the prince's dilemma deepened. To speak of the boar's presence would doom the creature, but to remain silent would condemn innocent lives.

In that moment, wisdom blossomed within the once-foolish prince. "Do you not know?" he replied. "**The eyes that see cannot speak, and the mouth that speaks cannot see.** My eyes may have beheld the boar, but they cannot give voice to that truth. And though my mouth can speak, it has not witnessed your quarry."

The hunter, bewildered by the prince's profound words, departed empty-handed yet enlightened. And so, through the divine mantra's power and his own unwavering honesty, the prince shed his foolish past, emerging as a wise soul revered by all.
